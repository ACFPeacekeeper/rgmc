# Robust Multimodal Generative Model


## Setup Conda Environment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate RMGM
```
## Setup Project
In order to setup the project, you simply need to execute the following command:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

This script setups the datasets, copies the code required to run the GMC framework from the [gmc repository](https://github.com/miguelsvasco/gmc) and defines the [m_path variable](https://github.com/MrIceHavoc/rmgm/blob/main/rmgm_code/main.py#L25).
